# turn_based_game

Randomly generating the game map. Each box can be either: Empty/Unavailable (dimmed)
For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn.**
Players can not pass through obstacles.
If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.
Each player attacks in turn
The damage depends on the player's weapon
The player can choose to attack or defend against the next shot
If the player chooses to defend , they sustain 50% less damage than normal
When the life points (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over.
